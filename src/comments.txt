Quick summary of my comments from our meeting!

4. It's really good to have tests that automatically check themselves- the simplest version
of this is something like if( function_call != expected_result ) printf("this specific test
case failed"). Having all your code / possible execution paths covered by tests of what
the expect behavior is lets you confidently change your code- like say you want to update
your hashmap collision strategy- having lots of tests will let you be sure nothing else
secretly got messed up. Also think about edge cases- things like empty input/ boundary input-
like what happens when the hashmap is empty? what about when it's full?
